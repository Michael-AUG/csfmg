Packet Radio Node

Berryhill Farm, Lanarkshire

Keeper - Michael GM5AUG

MB7NKL - 144.9375MHz and (soon) 70.4875MHz

This packet node links the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh (along the so-called 'Glasburgh route') using packet radio, enabling the fast routing of messages and other packet data across the country.
At the Glasgow end, the major routing node is GB7AUG, while in Edinburgh the major node is GB7NDH. 
GB7AUG also has a 40m (HF) port for onward connection down into England, while GB7NDH has various links further north and west.

It is hoped to begin trials of a 4m high-speed port at MB7NKL in the coming months, meaning that mail can be passed along the high-speed route, and user services can be accessed on the standard AX.25 2m port.
