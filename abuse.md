RSGB Repeater Abuse Information

Regrettably there are individuals who see repeaters as targets for abuse. It is a fact of life that the input of a repeater can be easily blocked, which denies the facility to legitimate users. Such behaviour, along with the use of abusive language and obscenities, is heavily punished if the perpetrator is caught. Ofcom regularly monitor repeater outputs and techniques of transmitter fingerprinting have led to numerous successful prosecutions.

Whilst sometimes it is hard to ignore such behaviour, repeater users are strongly advised not to respond in any way to such abuse. If the culprits get no reply they very often move elsewhere. If users have any information regarding abuse, it should be reported to the repeater management committee at RSGB HQ. (See also note above)

There is regular feedback of intelligence regarding abuse to Ofcom, which is well equipped to take any action necessary. Do not approach suspected offenders in any way, as this may prejudice investigations already in progress
